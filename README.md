# DATA-CLEANING

This repository contains the cleaned dataset . Initially, all data was in a single column, which I separated into 29 columns using Python. Using Excel, I checked for missing values and handled them appropriately, removed 23 duplicate rows, and deleted invalid ID = 0 entries. I also cleaned text columns to remove extra spaces, standardized column headers, and ensured all columns have the correct data types. The final dataset is clean, structured, and ready for analysis or modeling.

The cleaned dataset is saved under data folder !!
